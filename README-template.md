## Overview

### The challenge

The challenge is to build out the IP Address Tracker app.

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for each page depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- See their own IP address on the map on the initial page load
- Search for any IP addresses or domains and see the key information and location

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SCSS
- CSS Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Vanilla Javascript
- Fetch, and Async await
- IP Geolocation API by IPify
- LeafletJS

### What I learned

- I practiced css positioning and z-index, which was necessary in order to place the map below the IP details area, and also for the overlay and modal popups.
- I learned and practiced error handling with fetch.
- I practiced working with external javascript libraries like leaflet.js

### Continued development

- I will continue to use vanilla javascript in coming projects, but also begin to focus on react.js, a javascript library for building UIs.
